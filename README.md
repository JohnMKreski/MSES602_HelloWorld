# MSES602_HelloWorld

## Overview

This repository contains a basic Node.js application used in **MSES 602 – Introduction to DevOps** to demonstrate Continuous Integration (CI) concepts using Git, Jenkins, and SonarQube.

The project is intentionally simple and serves as a controlled application for testing automation workflows rather than as a production-ready system.

---

## Purpose

This repository is used to:

- Trigger Jenkins builds from Git commits
- Demonstrate Source Control Management (SCM) polling and automated build execution
- Install project dependencies using `npm install`
- Execute automated test scripts within a CI pipeline
- Run static code analysis using SonarQube
- Publish test results and build status within Jenkins
- Observe build outcomes such as SUCCESS or UNSTABLE states

---

## Context

This project supports hands-on lab exercises focused on:

- CI/CD pipeline fundamentals  
- Infrastructure provisioning with Ansible  
- Jenkins job configuration  
- Static analysis integration  
- Automated quality feedback loops  

The application itself is minimal by design, allowing focus on the DevOps tooling and workflow rather than application complexity.
